# Security Policy

Please report vulnerabilities responsibly.

- Prefer private reports via GitHub Security Advisories (Repository → Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability).
- Alternatively, open an issue using the "Security Vulnerability" template and add the `security` label. Do not include exploit details publicly.

Supported targets:

- Python 3.10–3.13
- Latest `main` branch of this repository

We aim to acknowledge within 5 business days and provide a remediation plan or fix within 30 days for high-severity issues.

Refer to the root-level [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for detailed, project-specific guidance (SQLite/WAL, Streamlit deployment, dependencies, and Windows scripts).
